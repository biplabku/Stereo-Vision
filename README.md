# Stereo-Vision
Computer vision is an important field of research wherein the techniques attempt to model the visual environment in using various mathematical model. Stereo vision is an area within the field that addresses the problem of reconstruction of 3D coordinate of points for depth estimation. In a stereo system two cameras are placed horizontally and the images acquired by the system are then processed for recovering visual depth information. The disparity map represents pixels that are horizontally shifted between the left and the right image. In this project, we present two methods of mapping disparity in stereo system images.
